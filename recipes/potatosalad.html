    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. 
            Drain, cool, and slice thin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. 
            Drain, crumble, and set aside, reserving drippings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry onions in bacon drippings over medium heat until they are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk flour, sugar, salt, celery seed, and pepper together in a small bowl; 
            stir into onions and cook until bubbling, then remove from heat. 
            Stir in water and vinegar; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, and simmer for one minute. Gently stir 
            bacon and sliced potatoes into the onion mixture until potatoes are heated through.
